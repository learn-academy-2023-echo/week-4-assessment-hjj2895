# ASSESSMENT 4: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is object-oriented programming? How is it different than functional programming?

Your answer: Object-oriented programming is a programming model that is based off on objects. It is utilized to organize large data structure by the use of objects that contain data. The difference between object-oriented programming and functional programming is that OOP is based on objects and methods and functional programming is based on the use of functions and variables. 

Researched answer: Object-oriented programming is a programming model that is based on the concept of objects. It uses objects to represent what is being programmed by organizing data that can be manipulated by the use of methods given to that object. The difference between OOP and functional programming is that OOP is based on the concept of objects and functional programming is based on the use of functions. The data used in OOP are mutuable whereas data in functions are immutable. The elements used in OOP are objects and methods whereas functional programming uses variables and functions. 

2. What is the difference between a Float and an Integer in Ruby?

Your answer: Integer in Ruby is a whole number. Float in Ruby is a number that contains a decimal point. 

Researched answer: In Ruby, an integer is a whole number like 5. A float is a number that contains a decimal point like 5.0. They are two different data types that will return a different out when used in an equation. For example, if you did 3 / 2, that will give an output of 1. However, if you did 3.0 / 2, it will give an output of 1.5 since a float was passed into the equation. 

3. Ruby has an implicit return. What does that mean?

Your answer: Implicit return means that in the last line of a method, the 'return' keyword is not needed as the last line of method is automatically returned. 

Researched answer: Implicit return means that the return value of a method will be returned by the last statement without the use of 'return' keyword. 

4. What is a block in Ruby?

Your answer: A block in Ruby is an anonymous function that is passed to a method. 

Researched answer: A block is an anonymous function passed into a method. It is defined by the keywords of 'do' and 'end' or can be wrapped in curly braces. 

5. How do you extract a single value from a Ruby hash?

Your answer: To extract a single value from a Ruby hash, you can print out the name of the hash along with a bracket notation with the paired key. 

Researched answer: To get a single value from a hash, you can log the name of the hash along with the corresponding symbol with the use of bracket notation. 

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

1. RSpec: is a testing framework for Ruby that test the behavior of objects. 

2. Test-driven development: is an approach in writing out the tests before writing the actual code. 

3. PostgreSQL: is a database management system that is free to use. It is also object-relational meaning it supports the use of object-oriented programming. 

4. CRUD: stands for create, read, update, and delete. It is a checklist in programming that are essential when working with databases. 

5. HTTP: is a protocol or the communication between servers and browsers. It is used for exchanging information over the internet.
